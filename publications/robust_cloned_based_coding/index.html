        Rapid advances in machine-learning based generative modeling of speech
        make its use in speech coding attractive. However, the current
        performance of such models drops rapidly with noise contamination of the
        input, preventing use in practical applications. We present a new
        speech-coding scheme that is based on features that are robust to the
        distortions occurring in speech-coder input signals. To this purpose, we
        encourage the feature encoder to provide the same independent features
        for each of a set of linguistically equivalent signals, obtained by
        adding various noises to a common clean signal. The independent
        features, subjected to scalar quantization, are used as a conditioning
        vector sequence for WaveNet. Our experiments show that a 1.8 kb/s
        implementation of the resulting coder provides state-of-the-art
        performance for clean signals, and is additionally robust to noisy
        input.
